			<h2>Why Life Insurance Is Essential for Americans in 2025</h2>
			<p>Over <strong>54% of US adults</strong> have life insurance, but millions are underinsured or confused about which type to buy. In 2025, the average US household faces $68,000 in debt and rising costs for education, healthcare, and housing. Life insurance is a critical tool for protecting your family’s financial future.</p>
			<p>According to <a href="https://www.limra.com/en/research/research-abstracts-public/2023/2023-life-insurance-barometer-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LIMRA</a>, term life is the most popular choice, but whole life is growing among younger Americans seeking lifelong coverage and cash value.</p>

			<h2>What Is Term Life Insurance? (Affordable Temporary Coverage)</h2>
			<h3>Definition & Features</h3>
			<p>Term life insurance provides coverage for a set period (10, 20, or 30 years). If you die during the term, your beneficiaries receive the death benefit. If you outlive the term, coverage ends unless you renew or convert.</p>
			<h3>Pros of Term Life Insurance (Why It's the Most Affordable Option)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Lowest initial cost: <strong>term life insurance rates</strong> average $20-$50/month for $500,000 coverage (30-year-old non-smoker)</li>
				<li>Simple, easy to understand (no investment component or complex features)</li>
				<li>Flexible terms (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years to match specific needs like mortgage payoff)</li>
				<li>Convertible to permanent in many cases (upgrade to whole life without medical exam)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Cons of Term Life Insurance</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>No cash value accumulation (pure protection only)</li>
				<li>Premiums rise with age or health changes upon renewal (can increase 5-10x after initial term)</li>
				<li>Coverage ends after term (97% of term policies never pay out - most people outlive their term)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="whole">
			<h2>What Is Whole Life Insurance? (Permanent Life Insurance Explained)</h2>
			<h3>Definition & Features of Whole Life Coverage</h3>
			<p>Whole life insurance is permanent coverage that lasts your entire life (no expiration). It builds <strong>cash value</strong> you can borrow against or withdraw, and premiums stay level. <strong>Whole life insurance cost</strong> averages $100-$400/month for $500,000 coverage.</p>
			<h3>Pros of Whole Life Insurance (Benefits of Permanent Coverage)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Lifelong coverage (guaranteed death benefit no matter when you die)</li>
				<li>Builds cash value (tax-deferred growth, typically 2-4% annually)</li>
				<li>Level premiums (never increase, locked in at issue age)</li>
				<li>Can be used for estate planning (bypass probate, create inheritance, pay estate taxes)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Cons of Whole Life Insurance</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Higher initial cost (5-15x more expensive than term life for same death benefit)</li>
				<li>Complex (fees, surrender charges, loan interest rates to understand)</li>
				<li>Returns may be lower than other investments</li>
			</ul>
