			<h2>LLC vs S-Corp: The Ultimate Legal Guide for US Entrepreneurs</h2>
			<p>Choosing the right business structure is one of the most important legal decisions for US entrepreneurs, and working with a qualified <strong>business formation attorney</strong> can save thousands in taxes and legal fees. In 2025, over <strong>2.5 million</strong> new businesses will incorporate, with LLC formation and S-Corp election as the most popular options. Whether you're forming an LLC ($500-$1,500) or incorporating as an S-Corp ($800-$3,000), understanding the legal requirements, tax benefits, and attorney fees is essential before you file. Once formed, you may also need <a href="business-line-of-credit-approval-guide.html">business financing</a> or an <a href="sba-7a-application-guide-2025.html">SBA loan</a> to fund operations.</p>

			<h2>What Is an LLC? (Limited Liability Company Formation Explained)</h2>
			<h3>LLC Formation Cost and Benefits for Small Business Owners</h3>
			<p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a flexible business structure that protects owners (members) from personal liability. <strong>LLC formation</strong> typically costs $500-$1,500 including state filing fees and legal assistance. LLCs are easy to form, require less paperwork, and offer pass-through taxation (no double taxation).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flexible management structure (member-managed or manager-managed)</li>
				<li>Pass-through taxation (profits/losses flow to personal tax returns)</li>
				<li>Limited liability protection (personal assets protected from business debts)</li>
				<li>Few ownership restrictions (unlimited members, foreign ownership allowed)</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="scorp">
			<h2>What Is an S-Corp? (S Corporation Tax Election Explained)</h2>
			<h3>S-Corp Tax Benefits and Requirements for Business Owners</h3>
			<p>An S-Corporation is a tax status for corporations or LLCs that meet IRS requirements. <strong>S-Corp election</strong> costs $800-$3,000 including attorney fees and IRS filing. S-Corps offer pass-through taxation plus self-employment tax savings, but with stricter rules on ownership, structure, and payroll.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pass-through taxation with self-employment tax savings (save 15.3% on distributions)</li>
				<li>Must pay reasonable salary to owners (subject to payroll taxes)</li>
				<li>Limited to 100 shareholders (all US citizens/residents, no corporate shareholders)</li>
				<li>Stricter compliance and paperwork (corporate minutes, resolutions, payroll tax filings)</li>
			</ul>
