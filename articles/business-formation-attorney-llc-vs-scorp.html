Form an S-Corp if your business profit exceeds $60,000-$80,000 annually and you want to save 15.3% self-employment taxes on distributions.

This combines LLC flexibility (simple management) with S-Corp tax benefits (self-employment tax savings on distributions). Most tax advisors recommend starting as an LLC and electing S-Corp status once annual profit exceeds $60,000-$80,000. This is the most popular structure for profitable small businesses."

Attorneys ensure proper operating agreements, multi-member ownership structures, asset protection compliance, and tax optimization strategies.

States like California and New York take 4-6 weeks. Expedited processing costs $50-$200 extra for same-day or 24-hour approval. After state approval, obtain EIN (same day online), open business bank account (1-3 days), and draft operating agreement (1-2 weeks with attorney)."

			<h2>LLC vs S-Corp: The Ultimate Legal Guide for US Entrepreneurs</h2>
			<p>Choosing the right business structure is one of the most important legal decisions for US entrepreneurs, and working with a qualified <strong>business formation attorney</strong> can save thousands in taxes and legal fees. In 2025, over <strong>2.5 million</strong> new businesses will incorporate, with LLC formation and S-Corp election as the most popular options. Whether you're forming an LLC ($500-$1,500) or incorporating as an S-Corp ($800-$3,000), understanding the legal requirements, tax benefits, and attorney fees is essential before you file. Once formed, you may also need <a href="business-line-of-credit-approval-guide.html">business financing</a> or an <a href="sba-7a-application-guide-2025.html">SBA loan</a> to fund operations.</p>

			<h2>What Is an LLC? (Limited Liability Company Formation Explained)</h2>
