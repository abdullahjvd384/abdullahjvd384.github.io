      <h2>When Should You Hire a Personal Injury Attorney?</h2>
      <p>If you've been injured in a car accident, slip and fall, or workplace incident, hiring an experienced <strong>personal injury lawyer</strong> can dramatically increase your settlement. After an accident, you may need both medical coverage through your <a href="health-insurance-open-enrollment-2025.html">health insurance</a> and legal representation. Many accidents involve <a href="auto-insurance-guide-2025.html">auto insurance claims</a>, but having an experienced attorney is crucial. In 2025, US accident victims recover an average of <strong>$77,000</strong> with a qualified <strong>accident attorney</strong>, compared to just $17,600 without legal representation. Most <strong>injury lawyers near me</strong> offer <strong>free consultations</strong> and work on a <strong>contingency fee basis</strong> (33%-40%), meaning you pay nothing upfront and only owe legal fees if you win. This guide explains when to hire a personal injury attorney, how to find the best accident lawyer in your area, and what to expect during your case.</p>
