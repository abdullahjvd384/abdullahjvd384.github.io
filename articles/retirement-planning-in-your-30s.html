      <h2>Why Retirement Planning in Your 30s Matters</h2>
      <p>Your 30s are the most powerful decade for <strong>retirement planning</strong> because you have 30-35 years of compound growth ahead. In 2025, the average American in their 30s has just <strong>$18,000</strong> saved for retirement, but experts recommend 1–2x your annual salary by age 35. By maximizing your <strong>401k contributions</strong> ($23,000 limit in 2025), contributing to a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> ($7,000 limit), and investing in low-cost index funds, you can realistically build a <strong>$1 million+ retirement portfolio</strong> by age 65. This guide covers proven retirement savings strategies, investment allocation for your 30s (80% stocks, 20% bonds), and how to take advantage of employer 401k matching to accelerate your wealth building.</p>

        <li><strong>401(k) or 403(b)</strong>: Employer-sponsored, tax-advantaged ($23,000 contribution limit 2025, employer match is free money - always contribute enough to get full match)</li>
        <li><strong>Roth IRA</strong>: Tax-free growth and withdrawals ($7,000 limit 2025, ideal for young investors who expect higher tax bracket in retirement)</li>
        <li><strong>Traditional IRA</strong>: Tax-deductible contributions ($7,000 limit, best if you need tax deduction now)</li>
        <li><strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong>: Triple tax benefits ($4,150 limit for individuals, functions as stealth retirement account)</li>
        <li><strong>Taxable brokerage account</strong>: Flexibility for extra investing beyond tax-advantaged accounts (no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties)</li>
