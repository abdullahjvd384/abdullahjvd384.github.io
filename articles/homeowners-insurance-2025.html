      <h2>Why Homeowners Insurance Matters in 2025</h2>
      <p>Did you know that <strong>93% of US homeowners</strong> have insurance, but over <strong>60%</strong> are underinsured? In 2025, the average US home value is $420,000, and natural disasters are on the rise. Homeowners insurance is not just a legal requirement for most mortgages—it's your financial safety net against fire, theft, liability, and more.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/homeowners-and-renters-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insurance Information Institute</a>, the average annual premium for homeowners insurance in the US is <strong>$1,428</strong>, but rates vary dramatically by state, coverage, and risk factors.</p>

      <h2>Types of Homeowners Insurance Coverage</h2>
      <h3>Dwelling Coverage</h3>
      <p>Protects the structure of your home against covered perils like fire, wind, hail, and vandalism. Most policies cover replacement cost, not market value.</p>
      <h3>Personal Property Coverage</h3>
      <p>Covers your belongings—furniture, electronics, clothing—against theft or damage. High-value items (jewelry, art) may need extra riders.</p>
      <h3>Liability Protection</h3>
      <p>Protects you if someone is injured on your property or you cause damage to others' property. Standard policies offer $100,000–$500,000 in liability coverage.</p>
      <h3>Additional Living Expenses (ALE)</h3>
      <p>Pays for temporary housing and meals if your home is uninhabitable due to a covered loss.</p>
      <h3>Flood & Earthquake Coverage</h3>
      <p>Not included in standard policies. <a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flood insurance</a> is federally backed; earthquake coverage is state-specific.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h4>1. What does homeowners insurance cover?</h4>
      <p>It covers your home, belongings, liability, and additional living expenses after a covered loss. Flood and earthquake are separate policies.</p>
      <h4>2. How much coverage do I need?</h4>
      <p>Enough to rebuild your home at current construction costs and replace your belongings. Review annually.</p>
      <h4>3. Does my credit score affect my premium?</h4>
      <p>In most states, yes. Better credit often means lower rates.</p>
      <h4>4. What is a deductible?</h4>
      <p>The amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance pays. Higher deductibles mean lower premiums.</p>
      <h4>5. How do I lower my premium?</h4>
      <p>Shop around, bundle policies, install safety features, and maintain good credit.</p>
      <h4>6. Are floods and earthquakes covered?</h4>
      <p>No, you need separate policies for these risks.</p>
      <h4>7. What if I rent out my home?</h4>
      <p>You need landlord or rental property insurance.</p>
      <h4>8. How do I file a claim?</h4>
      <p>Document damage, contact your insurer, and follow their claims process.</p>
      <h4>9. Can I switch insurers mid-policy?</h4>
      <p>Yes, but check for cancellation fees and ensure no coverage gaps.</p>
      <h4>10. What is replacement cost vs. actual cash value?</h4>
      <p>Replacement cost pays to rebuild/replace at today's prices; actual cash value subtracts depreciation.</p>
