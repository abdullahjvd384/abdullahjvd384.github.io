        <h2>What Is a Small Business Line of Credit?</h2>
        <p>
          A <em>small business line of credit</em> is a revolving financing tool that functions more like a credit card than a traditional loan. Instead of receiving a lump sum up front, you receive a credit limit—often $10,000 to $250,000—then draw only what you need, when you need it. You pay interest on the drawn amount, and as you repay, your available credit resets. This revolving structure makes a <strong>business line of credit</strong> ideal for recurring working-capital needs and uneven cash flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it’s flexible and reusable, a line of credit is commonly used to buy inventory, cover short payroll gaps, bridge receivables, and handle seasonal expenses. Many lenders review accounts annually and may adjust limits, terms, or pricing based on performance.

      <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How Does a Business Line of Credit Work?</h2>
        <p>Here’s the life cycle of a typical <strong>business line of credit</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Approval &amp; limit set:</strong> The lender sets a maximum credit limit based on your revenue, cash flow, time in business, and credit profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Draw funds:</strong> Transfer from the line to your business checking account or use your lender’s app/card to spend directly.</li>
          <li><strong>Interest accrues:</strong> Interest begins only on the amount you draw. Many products calculate interest daily and bill monthly.</li>
          <li><strong>Repayment:</strong> Make monthly payments (interest plus principal). As you repay, your available credit replenishes.</li>
          <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Most lines undergo periodic reviews (often annually) that can change the limit or rate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Used responsibly, a line of credit can enhance liquidity, smooth volatility, and help you capture opportunities—without committing to long repayment schedules like a term loan.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="secured-vs-unsecured">
        <h2>Secured vs. Unsecured Line of Credit</h2>
        <p>
          An <strong>unsecured line of credit</strong> usually does not require specific collateral, though lenders may file a general blanket lien or request a personal guarantee. Secured lines, by contrast, are backed by assets such as cash (a certificate of deposit), inventory, equipment, or receivables, which may qualify you for higher limits or lower rates.
        </p>

        <h3>When an unsecured option makes sense</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You need fast access to working capital and have strong cash flow and credit.</li>
          <li>You do not want to encumber specific assets.</li>
          <li>Your use is short term, with rapid repayment expected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When a secured option may be better</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You want a larger limit and potentially better pricing.</li>
          <li>Your business has valuable collateral that’s easy to value (e.g., CDs or A/R).</li>
          <li>You’re building credit and can’t yet qualify for the best unsecured terms.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="rates-fees">
        <h2>Rates, Fees &amp; Total Cost</h2>
        <p>
          Rates on a <strong>small business line of credit</strong> are often variable. They may be expressed as “Prime + margin” or a fixed APR for each draw. Compared to business credit cards—which can exceed 20% APR—lines of credit frequently offer lower rates, especially for established companies. However, consider the full cost:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interest:</strong> Accrues only on drawn balances.</li>
          <li><strong>Draw fee:</strong> Some lenders charge a small fee per draw.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintenance/annual fee:</strong> Covers account servicing and renewal.</li>
          <li><strong>Inactivity fee:</strong> Charged when you rarely use the line (not common but possible).</li>
          <li><strong>Late/NSF fees:</strong> Avoid by setting up autopay and cash buffer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Keep utilization modest (e.g., below 30–40%) and repay quickly to lower average daily balances and interest paid.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="eligibility">
        <h2>Eligibility, Documentation &amp; Approval</h2>
        <p>Requirements vary by lender, but common criteria for a <em>small business line of credit</em> include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time in business:</strong> 6–24 months minimum under current ownership.</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Sufficient, stable monthly sales and positive cash flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Solid business and/or personal credit history and responsible utilization.</li>
          <li><strong>Financials:</strong> Recent bank statements, P&amp;L, balance sheet, and tax returns.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal docs:</strong> Business formation docs, EIN, beneficial ownership info.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Banks typically have stricter underwriting and lower rates; online lenders may approve faster with higher costs. Compare <a href="/small-business-loans/">small business loan</a> alternatives if you need fixed repayment for long-term projects.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="uses">
        <h2>Smart Ways to Use a Business Line of Credit</h2>
        <p>Used strategically, a <strong>business line of credit</strong> can fund:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inventory purchases</strong> before peak season, repaid once goods sell.</li>
          <li><strong>Payroll bridges</strong> when receivables run late.</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing campaigns</strong> with short payback windows.</li>
          <li><strong>Supplier discounts</strong> for early payment (net-10/net-15 savings).</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency repairs</strong> or unexpected expenses that can be cleared quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid using a revolving line for long-term assets (e.g., vehicles, buildouts). For those, a term loan or equipment financing is usually a better fit.</p>

        <h2>Sample Draw &amp; Interest Calculation</h2>
        <p>Suppose you have a $100,000 <em>small business line of credit</em>. You draw $40,000 for 30 days at a 12% APR. Interest is typically calculated on the average daily balance:</p>
        <pre><code>Interest = Principal × APR × (Days / 365)
     = $40,000 × 0.12 × (30 / 365)
     ≈ $394.52
</code></pre>
        <p>If you repay the full principal after 30 days, your new available credit returns to $100,000, and you’ve paid roughly $395 in interest (plus any draw or maintenance fees, if applicable).</p>

      <section id="mistakes">
        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Carrying high balances too long:</strong> Treat your line as short-term financing; revolve quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Using it for long-term assets:</strong> Consider a term loan instead to avoid high ongoing interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring fees and covenants:</strong> Read the credit agreement carefully; watch for inactivity or draw fees.</li>
          <li><strong>Poor documentation:</strong> Keep financials current to ensure smooth renewals and potential limit increases.</li>
          <li><strong>Over-reliance on one lender:</strong> Maintain relationships and compare offers periodically.</li>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <h3>What is a business line of credit?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>business line of credit</strong> is a revolving credit facility that lets you draw funds up to a set limit, repay, and draw again. You pay interest only on what you use.</p>

        <h3>How does a business line of credit work day to day?</h3>
        <p>You transfer funds to checking (or spend via card/app), then make monthly payments. As you repay principal, your available credit is restored.</p>

        <h3>Is an unsecured line of credit right for me?</h3>
        <p>An <strong>unsecured line of credit</strong> can work if you have strong credit and cash flow, need flexibility, and prefer not to pledge specific assets.</p>

        <h3>What limit can I qualify for?</h3>
        <p>Limits often range from $10,000 to $250,000 or more, depending on your revenue, profitability, industry risk, time in business, and credit profile.</p>

        <h3>How are rates set?</h3>
        <p>Many lenders use a variable rate (e.g., Prime + margin). Your rate reflects business risk, time in business, collateral, and overall market conditions.</p>

        <h3>Does using a line of credit build business credit?</h3>
        <p>Yes—responsible usage, on-time payments, and low utilization can strengthen your profile and improve future loan terms.</p>
