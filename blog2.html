        <p>
            Pakistan faces a significant crisis in its education system, grappling with numerous challenges that hinder
            access, quality, and equity in education. Despite efforts to improve the situation, the country continues
            to struggle in providing a robust educational infrastructure for its population.

        <h2>Key Issues and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Access to Education:</strong> Millions of children in Pakistan remain out of school, with
            particularly low enrollment rates in rural areas and among marginalized communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Quality of Education:</strong> The quality of education in Pakistan is often subpar, characterized
            by outdated curriculum, inadequate infrastructure, and poorly trained teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Gender Disparity:</strong> Gender disparity remains a significant issue, with girls facing
            barriers to accessing education due to cultural norms, lack of facilities, and security concerns.
