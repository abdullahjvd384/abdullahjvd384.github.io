                <h2>Introduction to Business Lines of Credit</h2>
                <p>In today’s dynamic business environment, managing cash flow effectively is crucial for success. One
                    of the most flexible financial tools available is a <strong>business line of credit</strong>. Unlike
                    traditional loans, a <strong>line of credit business loan</strong> allows businesses to borrow only
                    what they need, when they need it, and pay interest solely on the borrowed amount.</p>
                <p>A <strong>business credit line of credit</strong> can be a lifeline for businesses looking to handle
                    seasonal fluctuations, fund new opportunities, or cover emergency expenses. From <strong>small
                        business loans and lines of credit</strong> to specialized options like <strong>TD Bank business
                        lines of credit</strong>, understanding how these tools work is vital for any business owner.
